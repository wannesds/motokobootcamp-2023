there's missing a 'query' because it's a public function to be called that returns a value and does not change any states ALSO missing Nat import

5. 
Theres a type problem, solutions:
A) remove all 'var' and replace 'var languages...' to 'let languages...'
B) (best solution) move var from func output type to in front of 'english' ALSO replace 'var languages...' to 'let languages...' ALSO 'return (Array.freeze(languages));'

6. 
missing Array import (ALSO Array.append being depreciated but it does works)
